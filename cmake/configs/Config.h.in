/**
 * @file Config.h.in
 * @brief Configuration template for CMake project versioning
 *
 * This template file is processed by CMake to generate a configuration header
 * with proper version information for the project. During the CMake
 * configuration stage, the @PROJECT_NAME@ and @PROJECT_VERSION_*@ placeholders
 * are replaced with actual values from the CMakeLists.txt file.
 *
 * Once processed, this header provides consistent version macros that can be
 * used throughout the application to access version information at compile
 * time.
 *
 * @note This is a template file and should not be modified directly. Changes
 * should be made to the CMakeLists.txt file that configures the project
 * version.
